# Classifying Images Based on Healthy and Unhealthy Skin

 This project classifies images based on healthy and unhealthy skin. In a world where many of us may worry about conctracting new illnesses or our friends and family who may have those illnesses, this project serves as a great way to detect if someone may or may not be healthy by observing a certain part of the body: the skin. This project has real-life applications, as it can be an idea used in medical places of work and can be done from a safe distance.

## The Algorithm
The algorithm of sorting healthy and unhealthy skin works by first being trained by being shown a series of images that are healthy and unhealthy. Through the resnet tool, AI learns certain features of healthy and unhealthy skin, like a series of bumps that the unhealthy skin photos would have. After the AI knows what images are healthy and unhealthy skin, the AI is shown a new set of images, labels them "healthy" or "unhealthy" from their pre-trained knowledge, and exports them to "healthy" and "unhealthy" output folders. Only "healthy" and "unhealthy" were the options for classifying the images, as determined by the categories defined in the labels.txt file in the project folder.
